### A Wedding Photographer's Website
I and my group friend Fatma Unal made the website of a wedding photographer. 
First, we chose a tab logo and added it next to the title.
Then we put a logo representing the business on the left side of the banner section of our site. We put the menu part on the side and the menu; We have divided it into 6 subheadings as home, about, gallery, guestbook, blog, call us.We linked all of these sub-headings to the relevant parts of the site with the in-site link command.
* When we click on the home button, a photo appears for the login page and the preview.
* About depends on the section with the business information at the bottom.
* The gallery is linked to this section with sample photos and there are 4 sample photos here.
* guestbook; It depends on this section, where there are 3 different packages created by the business, and customers can examine and buy. The buttons found here are linked to an email.
* blog; link to photographer's blog via off-page link.
* The Join us section is the application section reserved for those who want to join the business with an external link.
* Call Us; It is connected to a specified number and calls directly if it is allowed when clicked.
Another part is the part to make a reservation for those who want to talk to the operator. Finally, there is a map with the address of the business.
