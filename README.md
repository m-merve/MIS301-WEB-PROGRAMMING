## Wedding Photography
### A Wedding Photographer's Website
I and my group friend Fatma Unal made the website of a wedding photographer.
First of all, when you enter the website, a 4-second gift is greeted as the opening screen. Then the main screen opens.
Secondly, we chose a tab logo and added it next to the title.
We added a logo representing the business to the left part of the banner on the screen that opens.We added the menu to the right part of the banner.
We have divided it into 6 subheadings as home, about, gallery, guestbook, blog, call us.We linked all of these sub-headings to the relevant parts of the site with the in-site link command.
* When we click on the home button, a photo appears for the login page and the preview.
* About depends on the section with the business information at the bottom.
* Gallery; linked to this section with sample photos and there are 4 sample photos here.
* Guestbook; It depends on this section, where there are 3 different packages created by the business, and customers can examine and buy. The buttons found here are linked to an email.
* Blog; link to photographer's blog via off-page link.
* Join us; section is the application section reserved for those who want to join the business with an external link.
* Call Us; connected to a specified number and calls directly if it is allowed when clicked.

Another part is the part to make a reservation for those who want to talk to the operator.

Finally, there is a map with the address of the photographer.

We attach the project in ".zip" format because the file size is too large.
